A To-Do list app made over 24 hours focussing on functionality over design.

I set out to be able to create new tasks, complete tasks and then delete the completed tasks on a separted page. I enjoyed doing this project so spent a little extra time on it and added priority tags that were colour coded to priority and am currently working on sorting the tasks by either ascending or descending priority.

this extra work should be completed withing a couple hours of extra work
